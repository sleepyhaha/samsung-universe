## Developer Comments
This was the group project for Module 15 of the edX/Monash University Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.  The challenge was to create an intuitive application with the acceptance criteria seen below.  On the final day of the project we are required to give a presentation of which we will dicuss our application, our group dynamic, some of the troubles we had and future improvements on our MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

The acceptance criteria of this project were as follows:

```md
Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```
